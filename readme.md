  This script allows you to create multiple metafield definitions on a Shopify store via the GraphQL Admin API.
</p>



## Prerequisites

Before using the script, make sure you have the following:

- Shopify store domain (e.g., `store.myshopify.com`)
- API access token with sufficient permissions
- Source data query to fetch metafield definitions (can be obtained from the GraphiQL App)


## Install

Clone the repo and install requirements using pip
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/taksh108/shopify-metafields-sync.git
cd shopify-metafield-sync

```
Install the required Python packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the script using Python:
```bash
python metafield-sync.py
```

3. Follow the prompts to enter your Shopify API details, including the store domain, API access token, and owner type (e.g., PRODUCT).

4. Select a source JSON file containing your GraphQL query to fetch metafield definitions. This file should be in the same directory as the script or specify the full path to the file.

5. The script will create metafield definitions in your Shopify store based on the source data.

## Source Data
The source data query should be a GraphQL query that can be executed through the Shopify GraphiQL App or any other GraphQL client. An example source data query is provided below:
```qraphql
query {
  metafieldDefinitions(first: 250, ownerType: PRODUCT) {
    edges {
      node {
        namespace
        key
        name
        type {
          name
          category
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

```
